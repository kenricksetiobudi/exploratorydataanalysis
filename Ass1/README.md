## Folder Structure
Note that the folder structure of Assignment 1 here is very simple:
* The `codes` folder contains all the R scripts to run and generate the charts / plots
* The `plots` folder contains all the charts / plots that were required by the assignment

Once you open these folders, you should be able to locate the relevant files for review.
